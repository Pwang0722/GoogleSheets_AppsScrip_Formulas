---

### ï¼­ethod 

- Fill in the data under columns A to M in the sheet titled "TITLE LIST". Based on the data you have filled in, a code will be generated from a formula in column N.
- There is a formula in cell B19 in the sheets titled from "1B. ###" to "13A. ###", which retrieves the codes from column N in the "TITLE LIST" sheet and automatically fills in the data based on different requirements in each sheet.

  Formula example:
  ```bash
  =iferror(FILTER(List,('TITLE LIST'!N:N="ANIMAXCANTO FM00")+('TITLE LIST'!N:N="ANIMAXSOT ONLY00")))
  ```
